I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Management](https://business.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest lie on the intersection of Finance and Mathematics including but not limited to Timeseries/Financial Engeering/Risk Management and the application of Machine Learning & Optimization.   After making up my mind to build a strong foundation in mathematics thanks to USTC's principles, I chose to major in statistics. However, I recently realized that my interests in both fields are complementary, and I am eager to pursue this intersection again. This year, I want to study for my self-interest.
